# Insurance Claims Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project analyzes insurance claims data to identify and predict potential fraud using machine learning. The workflow covers exploratory data analysis, data wrangling, classification modeling, and results visualization.

## Workflow Highlights
- **EDA:** Analyzes distributions, relationships, and fraud indicators within claims.
- **Data Wrangling:** Encodes categorical data, handles missing values, and selects key predictive features.
- **Modeling:** Trains a Random Forest classifier to separate fraudulent from legitimate claims.
- **Visualization:** Presents feature importances, prediction probabilities, and exploratory plots for clarity.
- **Evaluation:** Reports accuracy, precision, recall, ROC AUC, and confusion matrix.

## How To Run
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insurance-fraud-detection.git`
2. Open `fraud_detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to reproduce analysis and generate results.

## Applications
- Useful for insurance analytics, risk teams, and anti-fraud tech demonstrations.
- Demonstrates strong data science workflow for technical recruiters and industry hiring.
